## 1. Sketch[#sketch]

### 1. Curve [#curve]
    - A line or curve made up of Vertices and Control Vertices is called a Curve.
    - To select, switch to [**Edge Selection Mode**](selection-mode).
    - Multiple curves can be connected and treated as a single curve.
    - Displayed in blue and turns yellow when selected.

### 2. Vertex [#vertex]
- The points at both ends of a Curve are called Vertices.
- To select, switch to [**Control Point Selection Mode**](selection-mode).
- Displayed as purple points, turning white when selected.
- When multiple vertices overlap, the point turns teal.

### 3. Control Vertex[#control-vertex]
- Points that define the shape of a Curve are called Control Vertices.
- To select, switch to [**Control Point Selection Mode**](selection-mode).
- Smaller than Vertices, displayed as purple points, turning white when selected.
- Vertices and Control Vertices are connected by white lines.
- Adding Control Vertices allows for more complex Curves.

### 4. Region [#region]
- An area enclosed by Curves is called a Region.
- To select, switch to [**Face Selection Mode**](selection-mode).
- Displayed as dark blue, turning light blue when selected.
- Selecting a Region automatically activates the [**Extrude**](/solid/extrude) command.

## 2. Solid[#solid]

### 1. Solid [#solid-1]
- A closed solid body made of multiple faces without any holes is called a Solid.
- To select, switch to [**Body Selection Mode**](selection-mode).
- Displayed as gray, with outlines turning yellow when selected.

### 2. Sheet [#sheet]
- An open body made of faces with holes is called a Sheet.
- Removing part of a Solid's face turns it into an open body, a Sheet.
- To select, switch to [**Body Selection Mode**](selection-mode).
- Displayed as gray, with outlines turning yellow when selected.
![Sheet](/img/sheet.png)

### 3. Face [#face]
- Each plane or curved surface that makes up Solids and Sheets is called a Face.
- To select, switch to [**Face Selection Mode**](selection-mode).
- Displayed as gray, turning light yellow when selected.
- Selecting a Face automatically activates [**Offset Face**](/solid/offset-face) command.

### 4. Edge [#edge]
- The boundary lines that surround Faces are called Edges.
- To select, switch to [**Edge Selection Mode**](selection-mode).
- Displayed as black lines, turning yellow when selected.
- Selecting an Edge where two Faces meet automatically activates [**Fillet**](/solid/fillet) command. Selecting an open Edge on a Sheet automatically activates [**Extend Sheet**](/solid/extend-sheet) command.

## 3. Empty[#empty]

### 1. Image [#image]
- Images imported using the Import function are called Images.
- To select, switch to [**Body Selection Mode**](selection-mode).
- Outlines turn yellow when selected.

### 2. Mesh [#mesh]
- 3D data such as STL and FBX imported using the Import function are called Meshes.
- To select, switch to [**Body Selection Mode**](selection-mode).
- Outlines turn yellow when selected.
