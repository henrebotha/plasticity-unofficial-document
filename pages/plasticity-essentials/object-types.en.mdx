# Object Types

## Sketch

### Curve
Line or Curve consisting of Vertices and Control-Vertices.
To select, set the [**Edge Selection Mode**](./selection-mode).
Multiple Curves can be joined and into one.
It is displayed as a blue line in the sketch. When you point the cursor at it, it turns white, and when selected, it turns yellow.

### Vertex
A point that exists at both ends of a  Curve and determines the position of the  Curve.
To display and select it, set the [**Control-Point Selection Mode**](./selection-mode).
It appears as a purple dot in the sketch. It turns white when you point the cursor on it, and stays white when you select it.
When multiple Vertices are in the exact same position, they are indicated by a blue-green dot. 
Note that this only indicates that the Vertices are in the same position and has nothing to do with the presence or absence of a connection.

### Control-Vertex (CV)
A point that exists in the middle of a  Curve and determines the shape of the  Curve.
To display and select it, set the [**Control-Point Selection Mode**](./selection-mode).
It appears as a purple dot that is smaller than the Vertex on the sketch. It turns white when you point the cursor at it and stays white when you select it.
Vertices and Control-Vertices are connected by a white line to make it easier to recognize their relationship to the Curve. By adding more Control-Vertices, complex Curves can be expressed.

### Region
The area is surrounded by Curves. To select, set the [**Face Selection Mode**](./selection-mode). 
It appears as a blue area in the sketch. When the cursor is pointed at the Region, the default command [**Extrude**](../solid/extrude) is automatically executed.

**Note**<br />
The result of the Extrude command is different when a closed Curve is selected and when a Region is selected: An extruded Curve becomes a Sheet, and an extruded Region becomes a Solid.

## Solid

### Solid
A fully enclosed three-dimensional object with no gaps in the surface. To select, set the [**Body Selection Mode**](./selection-mode). If you delete some Faces, it becomes a Sheet. It is displayed in gray in the 3D viewport, and the outline turns white when you point the cursor on it, and yellow when you select it.

### Sheet
An open surface built from one or more Faces. To select it, set the [**Body Selection Mode**](./selection-mode). It is displayed in gray in the 3D viewport, and when the cursor is pointed at it, the outline turns white, and when selected, it turns yellow.

### Face
The planar or curved surfaces that make up Sheets and Solids. To select, set the [**Face Selection Mode**](./selection-mode). It will appear gray in the 3D viewport, lighten when you point the cursor at it, and turn yellow when selected. When Face is selected, the default command [**Offset Face**](../solid/offset-face) is automatically executed.

### Edge
The border of a Face.
To select, set the [**Edge Selection Mode**](./selection-mode). It is displayed as a black line, which turns white when the cursor is pointed at it and turns yellow when selected. When the Edge of the boundary between two Faces is selected, the default command [Fillet](../solid/fillet) is automatically executed, and when the open Edge of a Sheet is selected, the default command [**Extend Sheet**](../solid/extend#extend-sheet) is automatically executed.
