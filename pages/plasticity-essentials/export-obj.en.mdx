# Export OBJ

1. Select the Solid or Sheet you want to export.
   - If nothing is selected, all displayed Solids and Sheets will be exported.
2. Click **Menu** > **Export/Save as...**.
3. A save-as dialog box will appear.
   - Enter the file name.
   - Select **Wavefront OBJ (*.obj)** as the file type.
4. The Export OBJ dialog box will appear.
   - Configure the options.

   | Option | Overview | Detail | Recommended Value |
   | ------- | ------- |------- |------- |
   | **Topology** |  | **The shape of the polygons to be converted** <br /> Tris (only triangular polygons) <br /> Quads (quadrangular and triangular polygons) <br /> Ngons (polygons with multiple sides, quadrangular, triangular polygons)||
   |**Density** |  | **This is the only value that automatically sets other values, so it's easy to achieve good results with this value alone.** <br /> Lower the value: fewer polygons, rough shape conversion.<br /> Increase the value: more polygons, detailed shape conversion.||
   |**Min width** | Minimum Size | **Specify the minimum size of the polygons.** <br /> To avoid congestion of small polygons, such as minute fillets, increase this value. |
   |**Max width** | Maximum Size | **Specify the maximum size of the polygons.** <br /> To avoid extremely long or large polygons, decrease this value. <br /> To make the size of the polygons more uniform, decrease this value. |
   |**Surface plane tolerance** | Maximum Allowable Deviation <br /> (in cm) | **Specify the accuracy of the conversion.** <br /> Lower the value: more polygons, detailed shape conversion.<br /> Increase the value: fewer polygons, rough shape conversion. <br /> Although less intuitive than Max width, this is one of the most common ways to increase or decrease the number of polygons. | A suitable value for low poly is 0.01, and for high poly is 0.0001. <br /> If you want to use a value smaller than 0.001, it may be better to decrease the Max width. |
   |**Surface angle tolerance** | Maximum Allowable Angular Deviation <br /> (in radians) | **Specify the accuracy of the surface conversion.** <br /> Lower the value: the  Curved surface is converted faithfully, and the number of polygons increases.<br /> Increase the value: the  Curved surface is converted roughly, and the number of polygons decreases.<br /> This can be thought of as the minimum number of segments, or elements, per circle or cylinder. | A suitable value is 0.35 (for low poly) to 0.15 (for high poly). |
   |**Curve plane tolerance** | Maximum Allowable Deviation of Edge <br /> (in cm) | **Specify the accuracy of the conversion of the Edges and Face boundaries.** <br /> This is similar to Surface plane tolerance, but affects the conversion of Edges and Face boundaries more than the center of the Face. ||
   |**Curve angle tolerance** | Maximum Allowable Angular Deviation of Edge <br /> (in radians) | **Specify the accuracy of the conversion of the Edges of curved surfaces (boundaries of the Face).** <br /> This is similar to Surface angle tolerance, but affects the conversion of Edges (boundaries of the Face) more than the center of the Face. | A suitable value is 0.35 (for low poly) to 0.15 (for high poly). |
   |**Curve max length** | Maximum Allowable Length of Curve (Edge) Segment |         |
   |**Plane angle** | Maximum Allowable Ratio between Plane Tolerance and Max Width | Useful for obtaining more quadrangles or polygons. |
