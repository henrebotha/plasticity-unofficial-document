# Construction Planes

Curves are created on the active construction plane. 
Construction planes can be the XY, YZ, or XZ planes, and you can also create new ones.

### Using the XY, YZ, and XZ planes

- <kbd>Numpad 7</kbd>: Use the XY plane. This gives you a top-down view.
- <kbd>Numpad 3</kbd>: Use the YZ plane. This gives you a view from the right.
- <kbd>Numpad 1</kbd>: Use the XZ plane. This gives you a front view.

### Creating a construction plane aligned with a surface

You can create a construction plane that aligns with the Face of a Solid or Sheet. 

1. Select the Face or Region you want to use as a construction plane.
2. Press <kbd>Space</kbd>.
3. The construction plane is created.
4. Your view will align with the created construction plane.

- If you don't want to change your view, press <kbd>Shift + Space</kbd> instead of <kbd>Space</kbd>.

### Creating a construction plane from multiple points

You can create a construction plane based on three or more points.

1. Select at least three points that you want to use as a construction plane.
2. Press <kbd>Space</kbd>.
3. If you selected three points, a construction plane will be created at the exact position. If you selected four or more points, the plane will be created at their averaged position.
4. Your view will align with the created construction plane.

- If you don't want to change your view, press <kbd>Shift + Space</kbd> instead of <kbd>Space</kbd>.
- You can also select a Region of a sketch to create a construction plane aligned with it.

### Creating a construction plane aligned with the current view

#### Creating a construction plane through the world origin

1. Position your view to the desired line of sight for the construction plane.
2. Press <kbd>Ctrl + Space</kbd>.
3. The construction plane is created.

#### Creating a construction plane through selected point

1. Position your view to the desired line of sight for the construction plane.
2. Press <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + Space</kbd>.
3. Click on the origin of the construction plane you want to create.
4. The construction plane is created.

### Saving and using construction planes

You can save your created construction planes for later use.

#### Saving construction planes

1. Click on **Temporary construction plane** at the top of the screen.
2. **Custom plane 0** will be added to the right side of the screen.

#### Using saved construction planes

1. Click on **Custom plane 0** on the right side of the screen.
2. The saved construction plane becomes active.

- Double-clicking on **Custom plane 0** will activate the saved construction plane and align your view with it.
