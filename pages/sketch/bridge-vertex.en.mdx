# Bridge Vertex[#bridge-vertex]

<Reference shortcut="" command="Bridge Vertex" button="" />

Bridges two Vertices that can be G0/G1/G2/G3 continuous. Tension is adjustable.

1. Select two Vertices you want to bridge.
2. Use the **Bridge**  command in the Command Palette.
3. Set the options in the Command Dialog and Keyboard Shortcuts. 
     - **T:**
          - **Value 1/2:** The relative position on the segment of the starting point/ending point.
     - **Direction:** 
          - **Direction 1/2:** Reverse the direction of the starting point/ending point.
     - **Tension 1:**
          - **Value 1/2:** The tension value affected 1st CV to 3rd CV of the starting point/ending point.
     - **Tension 2:**
          - **Value 1/2:** The tension value affected 2nd CV and 3rd CV of the starting point/ending point.
     - **Tension 3:**
          - **Value 1/2:** The tension value affected 3rd CV of the starting point/ending point.
     - **Start curvature:**
          - **G0, G1, G2, G3:** Specify the [continuity of the  Curve](../cad-essentials/continuity-curve-and-surface) at the starting point.
     -  **End curvature:**
          - **G0, G1, G2, G3:** Specify the [continuity of the  Curve](../cad-essentials/continuity-curve-and-surface) at the ending point.      
   - **Trim:** When turned on, any Curve that extends beyond the bridge will be trimmed.
4. Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.
