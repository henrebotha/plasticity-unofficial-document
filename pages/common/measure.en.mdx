# Measure

<Reference shortcut="Ctrl + =" command="Measure" button="" />

Measure dimension values such as the size of a rectangular curve or the diameter of a cylinder. 
Dimension values update according to the deformation of the measured object.

## Basic Usage

1. Press <kbd>Ctrl + =</kbd> or use the **Measure** command in the Command Palette.
2. Select the Curve, Edge, or snap point you want to measure.
3. Move the cursor to the desired axis and click to confirm the placement of the dimension.
4. Dimension values will be displayed, corresponding to the coordinate axes of the construction plane. Additionally, 'Measurements' will be added to the Outliner.

<Callout type="info">
- When measuring a coordinate axis perpendicular to the construction plane, you need to switch to the construction plane that includes it.
- You can display dimension values based on a user-defined construction plane. For instructions on creating a construction plane, refer to [here](/plasticity-essentials/construction-plane).
- To measure the distance between two points, right-click to confirm.
