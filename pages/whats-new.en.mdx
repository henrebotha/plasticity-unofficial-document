### New features

#### Blender Bridge

The Blender Bridge is a feature that allows for the rapid transfer of mesh data from Plasticity to Blender. This is realized as a Blender add-on. Once you've connected, you can just click refresh, and data is loaded really quickly. You don't need to worry about exporting to a temporary file and getting all the setting options right.

Even if you modify the geometry in Plasticity, the materials set in Blender are preserved. Additionally, the group structure in Plasticity is reflected as a collection in Blender. In this process, Blender's hierarchy is created using the Plasticity document name as an identifier. Therefore, multiple Plasticity documents can be incorporated into a single Blender document.

There's also a live link feature. The live link is a really cool feature; you can see stuff being updated in real time. The real workhorse of the Blender Bridge is the ability to quickly get assets in, so you can see them using Blender materials, Blender lighting, Ray tracing. You can view your objects in a scene with the real camera that might be used in a game or in a final render, with a specific FOV. You get the full power of Blender, including parenting things to empties, so you can animate them, rig them, and see if your mechanical parts fit together.

The workflow is also a fantastic experience. After placing the Plasticity document in the Blender scene, you can still change the faceting settings. Almost all of Plasticity's faceting tools are available within Blender. This means you can quickly get the polygon density or edge flow needed for your model, resulting in a faster workflow.

The specification of UV seams and sharps in Blender is not retained in the current version. However, the Blender add-on comes with features that automatically mark edges, automatically select geometry corresponding to Plasticity faces or edges, and merge UV seams. These features also contribute to a faster workflow.


#### Customizable radial menus #4

#### Hierarchical isolation

The functionality of the Isolate command has been enhanced to allow hierarchical hiding of objects. This significantly improves workflow in complex scenes. After narrowing down the objects displayed with the Isolate command, you can further select objects within that group and run the Isolate command again, leaving only the most recently selected objects visible. This feature can be repeated through multiple layers. The level of isolation is displayed on the screen, and clicking on it allows you to gradually revert back to showing more objects.

#### Multiple windows + copy/paste + place command for kitbashing
        * P > menu has "New Window" option. You can copy and paste between windows #23
        * copy-with-placement and paste-with-placement (ctrl-shift-c, ctrl-shift-v) #25

#### Many enhancements to Outliner

- Right-click on a group folder to access various related commands, such a s"Add current selection to group", "Select all", "New subgroup with current selection", collapsing or expanding all groups, and modifying materials.

- Scroll to selection: A shortcut has been provided to locate the object you've selected in the 3D viewport within the Outliner. 

- Isolate selection: A shortcut has also been provided to collapse all groups and sections, except for the one containing your selected object.

- You can perform bulk state changes—such as hiding, disabling, locking—by, renaming or modifying materials selecting multiple objects.

- Alt-click on group folder to select all objects in that section.

- Right-click on a section label ("Solids," "Sheets," "Curves") and choose "Select all" to select all objects within that section.


#### Chordal fillets

The Chordal option has been added to the solid fillet feature. The hallmark of a Chordal fillet is that it maintains a constant length for the chord of the fillet, regardless of the angles being filleted. This uniformity can be particularly beneficial when aiming for visual consistency across different parts of a model.
