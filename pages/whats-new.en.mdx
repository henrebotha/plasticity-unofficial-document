### New features

#### blender bridge #1

#### Hierarchical isolation

The functionality of the Isolate command has been enhanced to allow hierarchical hiding of objects. This significantly improves workflow in complex scenes. After narrowing down the objects displayed with the Isolate command, you can further select objects within that group and run the Isolate command again, leaving only the most recently selected objects visible. This feature can be repeated through multiple layers. The level of isolation is displayed on the screen, and clicking on it allows you to gradually revert back to showing more objects.

- Isolate selection: A shortcut has also been provided to collapse all groups and sections, except for the one containing your selected object.

- You can perform bulk state changes—such as hiding, disabling, locking—by, renaming or modifying materials selecting multiple objects.

#### Chordal fillets

The Chordal option has been added to the solid fillet feature. The hallmark of a Chordal fillet is that it maintains a constant length for the chord of the fillet, regardless of the angles being filleted. This uniformity can be particularly beneficial when aiming for visual consistency across different parts of a model.
