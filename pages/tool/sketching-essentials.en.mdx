# Sketching Essentials

## Accurate Snapping[#accurate-snap]

- Curves must be snaped accurately when you use the  Curves for surface modeling.
- When a Vertex is snapped to a Curve or another Vertex, it turns from purple to blue-green.

- To snap precisely
    - When moving a Vertex, hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> to enable snapping.
    - When drawing in a sketch, you can snap without holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> if **Object snapping** is enabled.
    - See [Grid and Snap](../plasticity-essentials/grid-and-snap) for more information.

## Snap Reference Lines[#snap-reference-lines]

- When drawing, you can create temporary reference lines to aid snapping. Point the cursor to an object and tap <kbd>Shift</kbd>. Snappable reference lines will appear.
